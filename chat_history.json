Why am I not getting it right?\n\nI want you to know that it's okay to feel that way. It's normal to feel frustrated, disappointed, and maybe even a bit hopeless. But here's the thing: failure is a part of the learning process, and it doesn't define your worth or intelligence.\n\nCan you take a deep breath with me and acknowledge that it's okay to not be perfect? That it's okay to make mistakes? You're not alone in this feeling, and many people have been in your shoes before.\n\nWould you like to do something to help shift your focus away from your exams for a bit? Maybe we could do a quick mindfulness exercise together? Sometimes, taking a few minutes to breathe and be present can help calm the mind and give us a fresh perspective."
